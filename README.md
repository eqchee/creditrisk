# Exploratory Data Analysis and Modelling for Credit Risk Prediction



## About The Project

Using data of customer features and their respective payment history, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to obtain useful insights about the customers. When creating the model to predict the credit risk of customers, it was shown that features which were engineered from the existing data helped to improve the performance of the model. As the dataset is imbalanced, where only 20% of the customers have high credit risk, oversampling the minority class also helped to enhance the model performance. Hyperparameter optimisation was also performed to further improve the model.
